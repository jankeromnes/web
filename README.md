> Hi! I am Dev.Tube – the place where developer videos live.

## How to run the app locally?

⚠️ While we are working on creating integration mocks, local dev mode is unavailable.

This web app comprises of `Vue` client app and a slim `node` server app, through which the client app is served.

``` bash
# make sure yarn is installed
npm install --global yarn

# install client app dependencies
yarn

# run client app
yarn run dev

# go to server app
cd express

# install server app dependencies
yarn

# download test data
mkdir data
curl -f --output data/loki.json https://storage.googleapis.com/dev-tube-index/loki-test.json
curl -f --output data/lunr.json https://storage.googleapis.com/dev-tube-index/lunr-test.json
curl -f --output data/board.json https://storage.googleapis.com/dev-tube-index/board.json

# run server app on
yarn run dev
```

Voila! The app is available via port `8100`.

Alternatively, you can also run the app in Gitpod, a one-click dev environment for GitHub:
